# Flavorful Insights 🍹

**Mock café database to practice SQL and reporting**

Flavorful Insights is a mini project I built to simulate a café ERP system. It’s all about **Postgres**, **SQL queries**, and **data reporting**, showing I can handle relational databases, joins, aggregation, and exporting tables to CSV.

# Why I Built This & What I Learned

The project was my way to practice real life SQL skills. It helped me:

- Understand how relation tables connect
- Practice reporting and aggregation queries
- Build portfolio-ready CSV exports
- Track everything cleanly with GitHub

## Features & Skills

- **Database Design**: Created `flavors`, `cafes`, and `orders` tables with relationships
- **SQL Queries**: Practice with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregation
- **Data Export**: Exported tables to CSV for reporting and portfolio display
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository to track code and share portfolio
